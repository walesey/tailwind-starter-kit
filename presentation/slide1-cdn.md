# Writting Tailwind css from CDN

- Great for rapid prototyping.
- Keep everything simple and in 1 html file

## Limitations

- CSS file is bloated with unused classes from tailwind.
- Can't override default tailwind theme, without hacky custom css.
- Can't use tailwind directives like `@apply` in your custom css.
